# ReactGenie Timer App Boilderplate

Here is a template for building a ReactGenie Timer. 
This includes React, CSS, and boilerplate React Genie code.

You will need to:
1. Update your own API Keys for Azure and Open AI.
Put your credentials into the `.env` file, see `.env.example` for reference.

2. Update `App.tsx` to integrate relevant providers and stores

3. Implement your React Genie state code in `genie/Timer.ts`

4. Integrate state code with UI in the React components defined in `src` folder

## Run App
Run Project `npm install && npx expo start --web`
Check the version of modules and `reactgenie-lib`. If there is something wrong, you can delete the `node_modules` folder and run it again.
